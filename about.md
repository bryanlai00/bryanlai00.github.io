Hi, I'm a recent December 2023 Graduate with a BASc in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from Stony Brook University. I have a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems. 
<br>
<br>
I have gained valuable experience in web development, game development, robotics, and API integration through various internships and projects. Most recently, I led a team of three members in developing a healthcare social media platform for hospital patients and their loved ones at Soter Technologies, reducing costs by 25% and enhancing mobile device authentication. I also designed multiple interfaces and GUIs for the device shipping website, increasing user engagement by 20%.
<br>
<br>
I have strong skills in Vue.js, React.js, MySQL, Java, and Python, as well as a keen interest in learning new technologies and frameworks. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to an entry-level position in the field of software engineering, where I can contribute to impactful and meaningful projects, collaborate with diverse and talented teams, and grow as a professional.
