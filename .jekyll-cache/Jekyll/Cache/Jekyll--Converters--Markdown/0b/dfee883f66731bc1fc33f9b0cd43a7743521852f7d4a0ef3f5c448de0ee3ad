Rather than relying on a complex content management system to serve content, this website is built with Jekyll, a “simple, blog aware, static site generator” written in Ruby. As a purely static site, no server-side processing is necessary after the site is initially built. Furthermore, this site is hosted on GitHub Pages, resulting in extremely fast page load times. Most of the content is formatted with Markdown, which gets converted into HTML when the site is built.

Interested in how our site is built? Our site is 100% open source; feel free to take a look at our source code to learn more about how we use Jekyll to create our website.
