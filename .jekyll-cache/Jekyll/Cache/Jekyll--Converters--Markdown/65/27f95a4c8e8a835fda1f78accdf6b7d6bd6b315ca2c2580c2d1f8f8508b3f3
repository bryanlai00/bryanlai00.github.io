      <p>I’ll be soon going to College at Stony Brook University to receive a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. Although most of my classes are in-person, I hope to meet many throughout this community and make a good impression as an incoming graduate. Stony Brook University, here I come!</p>

      <p>Back to school again. There’s nothing much to say other than the fact that I have robotics once again. More web duties = More work for me. I might not blog a bit after this since I’m focusing on different implementations for Team Manager and other web projects. Hope to see you soon!</p>

      <p>Snowfall, gingerbread cookies, and Christmas are only a fraction of the beautiful things that make up Winter. As fall comes to a close, we take a step closer towards 2020. I can’t wait.</p>

      <p>It’s Thanksgiving Break and I finally decided to work on projects I had pushed aside. One of the most important ones being a portfolio website, to display my skills in web development. Although I have studied Java, Python and a multitude of other languages, I wanted to delve deeper into web development. Instead of using Rails or Javascript, I’m utilizing Jekyll to make blog writing easier. Hope this goes well! =)</p>
