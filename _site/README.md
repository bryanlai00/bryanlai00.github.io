# Brief Introduction of myself:
Hello! My name is Bryan Lai, and I'm a student at Stuyvesant High School. I'm also a software engineer for my robotics team, StuyPulse! I focus on front end web development and helped partly in the creation of StuyPulse's scouting website! Click <a href="https://github.com/Team694/scoutpulse2018"> here </a> to see the repository! 
# Why I believe I'm fit for this position:
I believe I'm fit for this position for a multitude of reasons. Starting off, I have experience with front end development, and have mainly worked on front end web development during my sophomore year in high school. Although I may not know some skills in developing websites such as PHP, SSH, and Ruby, I'm willing to learn from mentors and other helpful members of StuyPulse.
